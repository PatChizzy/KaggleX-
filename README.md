# Project Directory
This repository contains the code for multiple projects related to data analysis and machine learning. Unfortunately, due to the large size of the data used in some of these projects, I was unable to push it to this repository. However, I have provided links to where you can find the data for each project.

The content of this repo is subject to change, as I'm still working on more projects.

## Osteoporosis
This project explores the classification of Osteoporosis in Knee X-rays using Deep-Learning and Transfer Learning Techniques. The code for this project can be found in the osteoporosis directory.

## WiDS Weather Prediction
This project involves predicting weather patterns using machine learning techniques. 

## Brief Intro
The WiDS Worldwide team at Stanford University, Harvard University IACS, Arthur, and the WiDS Datathon Committee organize this yearly datathon. 
This years' competition aims to improve sub-seasonal weather forecasting using machine learning. 
Accurate long-term forecasts of temperature and precipitation are crucial to help people prepare for extreme weather events caused by climate change. 

Data
The dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and can be found  link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/widsdatathon2023/data.
